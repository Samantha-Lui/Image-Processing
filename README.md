# Image Processing

This is a course projects of [CS 61B Data Structures](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/) taught by Prof. Jonathan Shewchuk at UC Berkeley. The goals of this project were to:

1. Implement two image processing operations on color images: blurring and edge detection, and

2. Write code to convert an image in TIFF format into a run-length encoding for compression and back.

I implemented these classes to achieve the goals. There are a few accompanying classes and jar files provided by the course for the execution of the project. Please refer to Project1.readme.pdf for the details of this project and visit [the course page to the project](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/hw/pj1/) to see the accompanying files.
